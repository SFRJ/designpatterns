/**
 *Your classes or methods have optional or special-case processing logic
 *Retain core logic but extract optional or special-case logic into Decorators
 *
 * Communication:
 * Some code just doesn't have to be run very often. But if you lump that code in with code that
 * does have to be run often, you don't communicate what is and what is not important.
 * Decorators give you a way to communicate what is core code from what is optional.
 *
 * Duplication:
 * As logic gets more complicated,you often see code that tries to
 * accommodate many combinations of behavior. This can lead to a lot of duplicate
 * code. Decorators offer a better way to handle diverse combinations of behavior without
 * duplicating code.
 *
 * Simplicity:
 * Code that mixes together the essential with the optional isnâ€™t
 * as simple as code that contains solely what is essential. On the
 * other hand, Decorators aren't always simple to use when you
 * have to worry about the order in which you add them.
