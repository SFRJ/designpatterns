/*Encapsulate subclasses into creation methods
 *
 *"Subclasses implement a common interface but are constructed in diverse ways
 * Encapsulate the subclasses with intention-revealing Creation Methods in the base class"
 *
 *Communication:
 *If it is important that client code talk with subclass instances via a common interface, it is important
 *to communicate this in your code. Creating subclasses doesn't communicate this very well.
 *Instead, create protected subclass constructors and Creation Methods that give clients access to the various
 *subclass types.
 *
 * Simplicity:
 * Figuring out which subclass to instantiate and how to instantiate it isn't as simple as calling
 *intention-revealing Creation Methods, particularly when you have several subclasses and numerous ways
 *to instantiate them. It is simpler if clients donâ€™t have to know about subclasses,but can instead obtain
 *instances from superclass Creation Methods.
